This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to improper handling of array keys when using foreach loops.  The issue arises when the array keys are not integers or when unexpected keys are present.

```php
<?php
$myArray = array("a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 3);

foreach ($myArray as $key => $value) {
  // Incorrect assumption:  The key is always an integer, which it is not here.
  echo "Element at index " . $key . " is " . $value . "\n";
  //Attempting to access array element using non integer key will result to unexpected behavior. 
}
?>
```

The problem lies in the assumption that `$key` is always an integer. In this case, the keys are strings ('a', 'b', 'c').  This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors depending on how you use `$key`.
